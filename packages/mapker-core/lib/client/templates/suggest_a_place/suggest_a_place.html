          <p><b>Do you know a place where makers can find tools, services or advices?</b></p>
          <p>
            Mapker is an comprehensive database of local maker places. This includes factories, labs, fabrication businesses, workshops and material suppliers - as well as tradesmen.
            <br>
             The platform is open access and free to use, for everyone.
             <br>
             To suggest a place, just fill a short form, it take about <b>1 minute</b>.
           </p>

          <p class="center">
            <button class="btn btn-primary user-action-open-modal-suggest-place">Suggest a place</button>
          </p>

          <p>
            At Mapker, we spend many hours researching and sourcing local places and we know that often the best are those hidden.
            <br>
            As part of opening up our process, anyone can now recommend places. Simply fill in this form, wait a couple days and we will let you know if they have been added to our list.
          </p>

          <h3>The more places you add to the list, the more useful it becomes, for everyone.</h3>
          <p>
            By suggesting places you are contributing to an open access resource used by thousands of people each month. The project is about providing free, practical information so mapkers can find more easily the resources they need.
            <br>
            We are asking for user-contributions, because we want to make Mapker as comprehensive as possible. We need the help of everyone that uses us, to improve it for everyone else.
          </p>

          <h3>Place Criteria</h3>
          <p>We visit and verify every factory listed on Mapker. If you are unsure who to recommend you can take a look at the factory criteria. These criteria were made so that Mapker is as useful as possible for the process of sourcing places.</p>
